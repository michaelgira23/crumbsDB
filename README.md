## Why crumbsDB?

### The Problem

The back-end of a website is a major part of your website (approximately 50%, because there's only two options (front-end and back-end)). However, querying the back-end for information can take **time** and **effort**. This **delay** subsequently causes the user to get **frustrated** which leads to **terrible user experience**. From this, we can derive that a **back-end** leads to **terrible user experience**.

### The Path to Enlightenment

This is where crumbsDB comes in. Instead of querying the back-end, just store your data in cookies! This minimizes the communication and **increases user experience**.

### Other Benefits

Additionally, replacing your database with cookies means **less server costs** which leads to **revenue** and **profit**. Really, this is a win-win situation which I think means it's **synergy**.
